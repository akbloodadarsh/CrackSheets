Technical Round

*****************************General***********************
* What’s your favorite subject?
= DSA,OOPS,C++

* procedural programming language:-
= we have given a step by step instruction like c,ex:- we want to print every line from a file in c languages we have to write that how we will access the file and retirve the data from it, but in declatrive programming langye we say what we want, and we dont state how to get it,like sql we dirctly write what data we wnat to obtain from which table.Ex:- select moviename from movies where year>2000, no for loops is used etc..

* When I see a new emerging technology, how I research about it? Explain one technology I have recently researched about.
=

* Which is the most important stage in SDLC?
= each and every stage in sdlc is importnat, if we remove one step in cycle the their is a chance that the product will crash.

* Who invented Java
= James Gosling

* Is it possible to call one constructor from another in Java?
= Yes, any number of constructors can be present in a class and they can be called by another constructor using this() [Please do not confuse this() constructor call with this keyword]. this() or this(args) should be the first line in the constructor. This is known as constructor overloading.

* What was the name of java before named “java”
= The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.

* How to run a java program
= From Terminal install open jdk sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk. Write a java program and save the file as filename.java.Now to compile use this command from the terminal javac filename.java.To run your program that you've just compiled type the command below in terminal: java filename.

* why we need java as we have c, c++
= We need Java because it vastly increases the abstraction level, so developers do not need to worry about memory management and safety, garbage collection etc. So we can focus on the work and therefore increase our productivity. One is the use of bytecode and the desire to have a write once, run anywhere language.

* Software Development Life Cycle?
= Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

*What are the different stages in it?
= Feasibility study:- possible to make software or not
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document to Defining Requirements
3. Designing the Product Architecture Design Document Specification. This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.
4. Building or Developing the Product
5. Testing the Product
6.  Deployment in the Market and Maintenance

* how hashing works and its uses.
= An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table. The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

* What are the different Life Cycle Model?
= SDLC models followed in the industry −
Waterfall Model
Iterative Model
Spiral Model
V-Model
ITerative waterfall model
Agile
Dvops
Big Bang Model

* Which one of them is best and why?
= 

* What is the difference between concatenation of strings using ‘+’ and Stringbuffer. Advantages and Disadvantages of both and the instances where one would perform better than the other.
= String class is immutable thus when you concat too many strings because every time it creates new instance,it is slow.

* Briefly explain about Java
= orcale is responsible for maintancenc and improvement, it is 99% oops and 1 % is becuas of primitve datatyep. passed in refrence, contians packages mroe than 1200

* what happens if we don’t use static in main method?
= jvm dosent create a insance of the class, and it simply use the class name abnd call main emthod, jvm dosnt do that so it dosnt create a onstance of the class, and initialize the variable using constusctor if available.

= a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.

**************************OS**************************
*What is Operating System?
= It acts as a resource manager(process,memory management),provides security & maintainence(their are daemons runnning in the background) provides convinence and gives us utilities,can be used even by someone from a non technical background and suppose a programmer writes some code in some programming language then like:- printf and we run that then we dont need to worry about how operating system displays the otput on the screen, and if a non technical is using chrome to browse internet , then os provides its resources and help it to connect to wifi using NIC, and the user need not to worry about how is it connecting, and if we want to search some file or app then we type its name and os finds it for us

**************************DBMS*****************************
* What is SQL?
= Structured query language, it started as a research project at IBM ,by boyee and codd, it has became a standard way to query, update, delte, modigy or insert in a database. It is a domain specific language, means that it can be only in database, ex:- we cant build a OS,webiste etc using sql, declatirve programming language,
* What is the candidate key?
= A subset or a set of superkey attributes from whihc we can determine all the attributes is known as candiate key or a minimal attribute super key is called a candidate key,ex:- Super keys:- {A, bc} from which we can determine all the attributes then A will be the candidate key because it has minimum attributes from whihc we can dtermine all the other attributes or the closure of A+ can determine all the other attributes. Always check if their exist a subset of superkey by whihc if we find the closure of the subset of superkey if we are getting all the attributes or not.

IMP :- and we have to keep in mind one thing that if their exist a attribute whihc is not reachable by any functional dependency then we have to consider that in every candiate key.

* What is super key?
= A subset or a set of attributes from whihc we can determine every other attribute then it is called a superkey.Ex:- Attributes a,b,c,d,e  and assume AB is superkey then their exist some functional dependency among the attribtes by whihc which when using Ab as super key we can determine every attribute.  

* Trivial vs Non trivial functional dependency
= If XY->X :- Trivial  when RHs is a subset of LHS 
  If X->C :- Non Trivial  When RHS is not a subset of LHS
   
* Cascade:- 
= It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the child data is either deleted or updated when the parent data is deleted or updated.It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the child data is set to NULL when the parent data is deleted or updated.

* what is schema?
= How the data is organized & what are the tables and its relation between them

* What is database?
= so what makes database differnet from traditional way of storeing and retrieveing or performing operations on data in file system is that database use various concepts like indexing,queriey optimizer etc, which makes it way faster , to make operations like updation,deletion, modfifyication,insertipon,deletion way faster,than a tradition file system.

SQL-> PARSER,compiler -> query optimizer
parser:- breaks the queirey in chunks and tries to understand instruction then complier compiles it insome language like c,c++, java or in whihc the db it is writeen internally,
query optimizer = it says what is the most optimal way  to execute this statment, what is the best sequence we should execute, or what data structure we should use, and different database like, orcale, mysql etc will have different database
executor:- whihc executes the code

** Data manipulation langauage?DML
= SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

* SELECT CMD
= used to generate a result set with the tcolumns names mentione along with thier metadata.
the order of the column could be anything as given by the user, example we can select movie name first then year or vice-versa, a simple select query wil preserve the order of the data
 SELECT movie,year FROM movies;
 SELECT * FROM movies;
 
* INSERT
// single row insert
= INSERT INTO movies(id,name,year) VALUES (4155,'SCHINDLER LIST',1998)
// multiple row insert
INSERT INTO movies(id,name,year) VALUES (4155,'SCHINDLER LIST',1998), 4155,'JOBS',1999)
// Insert from one table  to another
INSERT INTO movies SELECT * FROM old_movies WHERE name IN ('pratt','lisa')
// Insert from one table  to another when schema are not same
INSERT INTO movies(id,movie) SELECT oid,omovie, FROM old_movies WHERE name IN ('pratt','lisa')

* UPDATE
= UPDATE movies SET movie="Gone",year=0 WHERE year = 1990; 

* DELETE 
= DELETE FROM movies WHERE id = 1;
if you want to remove all rows then same cmd but without a where clause


** DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
** CREATE
CREATE TABLE tname (id INT PRIMARY FOREIGN, lang VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)
we can write data type along with constraint to the columns

Constrians can be:-
NOT NULL:- ensure that column iis ntot null
UNIQUE:- eNSURe that eveyr value is unique
PRIMARY KEY:- A combination of not null andunique
FOREIGN KEY:- uniquely identifies a row/record in another tbale
CHECK:- Ensure that all values ina column satisfies a specific condiiotn
INDEX :- used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
(Indexing technizues are use dsucha as hashing, B+tree)

* ALTER
:- ADD, MODIFY DROP
= ALTER TABLE tablename ADD columnname DATATYPE(limit);
= ALTER TABLE tablename MODIFY columnname DATATYPE(limit);
= ALTER TABLE tablename DROP columnname;

* DROP
removes table along wiht all the data permananetly
= DROP TABLE tablename;
= DROP TABLE tablename IF EXISTS;

* TRUNCATE
= TRUNCATE TABLE tablename;

* DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE
= GRANT , REVOKE
// user1 has access to that database
GRANT ALL ON db1 TO 'USER1'@'localhost'

// user1 has access to all database to run ALL the queries
GRANT ALL ON * TO 'USER1'@'localhost'
// role1 and role2 gets assigned to user1,user2
GRANT 'role1','role2' TO 'user1'@'localhost1','user2'@'localhost2';
// role3 gets access to world database to run select quesries
GRANT SELECT ON world TO 'role3';

* REVOKE
= Takes away the privelages
REVOKE INSERT ON *.* FROM 'Jefery'@'localhost';
REVOKE 'role1','role2' FROM 'user1'@'localhost','user2'@'localhost';
REVOKE SELECT ON world.* FROM 'role3';
******

* Aggrgate functions:- computes a single value on a set of rows and returns a aggregate,Ex:- 
COUNT, MIN,MAX,SUM,AVG
SELECT MIN(year) FROM movies;
SELECT MAX(year) From movies;	
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies; // return number of rown in movies
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE year>2000

* what is distinct command
= It can be applied on single column and multiple columns
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies_genre; // slect all the distinct genre from movies_genre table and genre column o/p will be comedy, horror etc
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM DIRECTORS ORDER BY first_name; // string firstname and last name combined should be unique

* SHOW CMD
//To see all the tables we have
= SHOW TABLES;

* DESCRIBE CMD
= If you want to check teh detials of the tabel
 DESCRIBE table_name

  
* GROUP BY CMD;
= It groups the rows as the per the coulmn we choose,It will create a set of the specific items we choose to group together even NULL values.
SELECT year, COUNT(year) FROM movies GROUP BY year;
internall It will create a table for all the distinct year and in each of those it will contains the detials of the all the movies whihc are released in that year and then it will output the number of movies which are released in that year along with the year.   
2001{moviedeatails1,moviedetails} 
2002{moviedetials3,dmovies details4}
O/P 2001 50004
     2007 4568
SELECT year, COUNT(year) FROM movies GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;

* WHERE and conditinal statemns
= WHERE is applied on individual rows and we use conditions along with them
Conditions :-
Not equal to:-   != <>
Equal to:-   =    (NOTE:-  = does not work with NULL,  Ex:- SELECT movie FROM movies WHERE rank = NULL;)
thus we use IS NULL & IS NOT NULL
SELECT movie FROM movies WHERE rank IS NULL;
SELECT movie FROM movies WHERE rank IS NOT NULL; 

// sleect all comedy movies genre
SELECT movie FORM movies WHERE genre = "COMEDY"; 

* lOGICAL Operators
= LIKE CMD
// For string 
// Prefix could be anything but at the end it should M
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE '%M', O/P blaM, MGOeqwG
// Sufffix could be anything but at the start it should M
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE 'M%', O/P blaM, MGOsdwG
// prefix & suffix could be anything but middle should M
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE '%M%', O/P blaMadsa, adsMGeqwOG
// at the _ their could be any character but the prefix and suffix should be same
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE 'M_ok', O/P Mbok, Mcok
in % their can be 0 or more chracter but in _ their has to be 1 charter
Use escape character \ if you want to treat  % and _ symbol as a normal charcter & not as a special symbol
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE '\%M\_ok', O/P %M_ok

* EXISTS
= The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery. The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.
SELECT SupplierName FROM Suppliers WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.SupplierID AND Price < 20) ORDER BY SupplierName;

SELECT moviename FROM movies WHERE EXISTS(SELECT director FROM directors WHERE movies.directorname = director)

* AND CMD
= for using multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE first_name LIKE "MID" AND last_name = "3"; 

* OR CMD
= if any conditon is true
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE first_name LIKE "MID" OR last_name = "3"; 

* IN CMD
= Equivalent of multiple AND condition but it creates a set and check if the item mentionsed is in the set or not
= SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genre IN ('COMEDY',HORROR);

* NOT CMD
= SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genre NOT IN ('COMEDY',HORROR);

* BETWEEN CMD
= SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2000;
Equivalent to in between a range but we have to check the lowvalue and high value
 SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 1999;
 thenn it will give a empty set
 
* HAVING 
where is used on individual rows and having is applied on groups
if we dont have group by having is same as where
// having is applied after grouping , where is applied before grouping
// FIND OUT ALL THE yEARS in WHich 1000>movies are releases
SELECT years, COUNT(years) year_count FROM movies GROUP BY years HAVING year_count>1000;

SELECT year, COUNT(years) years_count FROM movies WHERE rank>9 GROUP BY years HAVING years_count>1000;  

* LIMIT CMD
= 
//suppose we want only first 20 rows
SELECT year, name FROM movies LIMIT 20

* OFFSET
= how many rows from the start you wantr to ignore
// suppose in a webpage in our page 3 we want 40-60 rows from our table, or we want to ignore the first 40 rows and then get 20 rows 
SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40

* ORDER BY CMD
= It is used to sort the data , and for descending order we use DESC after applying ORDER BY

// select the top 10 movies in their descending year
SELECT movie FROM movies ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 10

* EXISTS
= It return true if a subqueirey return 1 or more values or not a empty set else it return false

* ALL
= returns true if the all the values in the set whihc is returned after the sub query meets the conditions stated
Ex:- SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rankscore >= ALL (SELECT MAX(rankscore) FROM movies);

* ANY
= returns true if any of the values in the set whihc is returned after the sub query, meets the conditions stated
Ex:- SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rankscore >= ANY (SELECT MAX(rankscore) FROM movies);
get all the movies whose rankscore >= maximum rankscore 

C-related subqueries:- & query withing a query where we have doing that operation again and again, and query optimizer may or may not optimi=ze the operation,more redable than some complex JOIns,
Ex:- SELECT emp_no,name FROM employees emp WHERE salary> (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = emp.department);

***JOINS
t1 columns, c1,c2....
t2 c2cc6..
left c1,c5,c3 && right c4,c2,c6   combined c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6
* INNER JOIN
= If we have table1 as T1 & Table 2 as T2 THEN INTERVSECTION the intersection of their columns along with the common rows wil be outputd

SELECT * FROM T1 JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; || SELECT * FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2;  // Intersection of c1 from t1 & c2 from t2 

* LEFT OUTER JOIN
= get all the values in left column and join it with right column and where it has same values fill the values of right and where it is not then place NULL their
Ex:- SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; || SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; // all values of left column with intersection of right column values

* RIGHT OUTER JOIN
= get all the values in left column and join it with right column and where it has same values fill the values of left and where it is not then place NULL their
Ex:- SELECT * FROM T1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; || SELECT * FROM T1 RIGHT JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; // all values of left column with intersection of right column values

* FULL OUTER JOIN
= Its union of everything and if we are not able to find some same value in the column then place NULL their, its same as union of left outer join and right outer join
SELECT * FROM T1 FULL OUTER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2;
  
* Natural JOin
= A join where we have same column name across two tables,after joining the tables only a single column will exist with the same name
Ex:- T1 :- c1,c2
T2:- c1,c3,c4
SELECT * FROM T1 JOIN T2; || SELECT * FROM T1 JOIN T2 USING (c1);
crtes a table wiht columns c1,c2,c3,c4, no need to use ON clause

* K-joins
SELECT a.first-name, a.last_name FROM actors a JOIN roles r ON a.id=r.actor_id JOIN movies m ON m.id=r.movie_id AND m.name='Officer 444';
 joins are computationally most expensive
 
* what is a alias?
Suppose i want to sort by the count of year, and i use order by and i used the aggreater COUNT(year) then it wont work because it is aggregator opertor keyword, thus we have to use some other name for that to work, and we simply use a alias(year_name). 
= SELECT year, COUNT(year) year_name FROM movies GROUP BY year ORDER BY year_name;

What is DBMS?

 What is the primary key?
  What is BCNF?
  What is ACID Property ??
Explain the meaning of each term in ‘ACID’ .
Give one real life example of ‘D-Durability’ ??
* how to do normalization?
= first find out all candiate keys, then write down all the prime attributes, check its in 2 nf, no part of a candite key is detrmining a non prime attribute, then remove any transitive dependancey, by giving them a seperate relation or table, and making them the superkey for that table
* What is Normalization ?
= Decomposition of set of attributes to minimize redundancy in such a way that relation function dependanccey between attributes remains lossless & reduce anomalies.

* What are the anomalies of Normalization?
= Insertion, update and deletion anomaly. when not in 1NF,2NF----4NF

*Types of Normalization?
= 1NF:- Their is no multivalued attribute, if their is then split it into seperate rows.
2NF :- When their exist no part of a candiate key determininga non prime attribute,partial dependencey(part of a candidate key or proper subset determines some other attribute other than itself) and relation is in 1NF, if their exist PD, then remove it by creating another relational table.
3NF:- For all non-trivial FD, When X->Y WHERE Y is a prime attribute then we have to remove that, & we are in 2NF.All prime attribute must depend on a s-key. no non prime attribute is transitively dependant ona key. No non prime attribute is depending a non prime attribut.
Ex:- X->Y, Y->Z, Z->A
NOTE:- Either X->Y   , either X is a superkey or Y is a prime attribute
**BCNF= Every FD X->Y , x is a superset of & Y its subset, (trivial) & X is superkey, Every BCNF is in 3 NF. or X->Y then either X has to be a super key or Y has to bea prime attribute
Note:- X->Y , X is auper key

** Achievabilty of BCNF
we cannot always gaurantee 
lossless, dependency preserving and BCNF
R(ABC)     FD{AB->C,C->B}
R1(AB)  =  {AB}
R2(CB)  = {CB}

* What do you mean by cryptocurrency?
= A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.

* What is a Thread?
A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
Why Multithreading?
A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading are discussed below

* Process vs Thread?
The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.
Threads are not independent of one another like processes are, and as a result threads share with other threads their code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals). But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), register set, and stack space.
