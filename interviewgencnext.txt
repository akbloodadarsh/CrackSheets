Technical Round

*****************************General***********************
* What’s your favorite subject?
= DSA,OOPS,C++

* procedural programming language:-
= we have given a step by step instruction like c,ex:- we want to print every line from a file in c languages we have to write that how we will access the file and retirve the data from it, but in declatrive programming langye we say what we want, and we dont state how to get it,like sql we dirctly write what data we wnat to obtain from which table.Ex:- select moviename from movies where year>2000, no for loops is used etc..

* When I see a new emerging technology, how I research about it? Explain one technology I have recently researched about.
=

* Which is the most important stage in SDLC?
= each and every stage in sdlc is importnat, if we remove one step in cycle the their is a chance that the product will crash.

* Who invented Java
= James Gosling

* Is it possible to call one constructor from another in Java?
= Yes, any number of constructors can be present in a class and they can be called by another constructor using this() [Please do not confuse this() constructor call with this keyword]. this() or this(args) should be the first line in the constructor. This is known as constructor overloading.

* What was the name of java before named “java”
= The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.

* How to run a java program
= From Terminal install open jdk sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk. Write a java program and save the file as filename.java.Now to compile use this command from the terminal javac filename.java.To run your program that you've just compiled type the command below in terminal: java filename.

* why we need java as we have c, c++
= We need Java because it vastly increases the abstraction level, so developers do not need to worry about memory management and safety, garbage collection etc. So we can focus on the work and therefore increase our productivity. One is the use of bytecode and the desire to have a write once, run anywhere language.

* Software Development Life Cycle?
= Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

*What are the different stages in it?
= Feasibility study:- possible to make software or not
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document to Defining Requirements
3. Designing the Product Architecture Design Document Specification. This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.
4. Building or Developing the Product
5. Testing the Product
6.  Deployment in the Market and Maintenance

* how hashing works and its uses.
= An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table. The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

* What are the different Life Cycle Model?
= SDLC models followed in the industry −
Waterfall Model
Iterative Model
Spiral Model
V-Model
ITerative waterfall model
Agile
Dvops
Big Bang Model

* Which one of them is best and why?
= 

* What is the difference between concatenation of strings using ‘+’ and Stringbuffer. Advantages and Disadvantages of both and the instances where one would perform better than the other.
= String class is immutable thus when you concat too many strings because every time it creates new instance,it is slow.

* Briefly explain about Java
= orcale is responsible for maintancenc and improvement, it is 99% oops and 1 % is becuas of primitve datatyep. passed in refrence, contians packages mroe than 1200

* what happens if we don’t use static in main method?
= jvm dosent create a insance of the class, and it simply use the class name abnd call main emthod, jvm dosnt do that so it dosnt create a onstance of the class, and initialize the variable using constusctor if available.

**************************DBMS*****************************
* What is SQL?
= Structured query language, it started as a research project at IBM ,by boyee and codd, it has became a standard way to query, update, delte, modigy or insert in a database. It is a domain specific language, means that it can be only in database, ex:- we cant build a OS,webiste etc using sql, declatirve programming language,
* What is the candidate key?
= A subset or a set of superkey attributes from whihc we can determine all the attributes is known as candiate key or a minimal attribute super key is called a candidate key,ex:- Super keys:- {A, bc} from which we can determine all the attributes then A will be the candidate key because it has minimum attributes from whihc we can dtermine all the other attributes or the closure of A+ can determine all the other attributes. Always check if their exist a subset of superkey by whihc if we find the closure of the subset of superkey if we are getting all the attributes or not.

IMP :- and we have to keep in mind one thing that if their exist a attribute whihc is not reachable by any functional dependency then we have to consider that in every candiate key.

* What is super key?
= A subset or a set of attributes from whihc we can determine every other attribute then it is called a superkey.Ex:- Attributes a,b,c,d,e  and assume AB is superkey then their exist some functional dependency among the attribtes by whihc which when using Ab as super key we can determine every attribute.  

* Trivial vs Non trivial functional dependency
= If XY->X :- Trivial  when RHs is a subset of LHS 
  If X->C :- Non Trivial  When RHS is not a subset of LHS
   
* what is schema?
= How the data is organized & what are the tables and its relation between them

* What is database?
= so what makes database differnet from traditional way of storeing and retrieveing or performing operations on data in file system is that database use various concepts like indexing,queriey optimizer etc, which makes it way faster , to make operations like updation,deletion, modfifyication,insertipon,deletion way faster,than a tradition file system.

SQL-> PARSER,compiler -> query optimizer
parser:- breaks the queirey in chunks and tries to understand instruction then complier compiles it insome language like c,c++, java or in whihc the db it is writeen internally,
query optimizer = it says what is the most optimal way  to execute this statment, what is the best sequence we should execute, or what data structure we should use, and different database like, orcale, mysql etc will have different database
executor:- whihc executes the code

* Aggrgate functions:- computes a single value on a set of rows and returns a aggregate,Ex:- 
COUNT, MIN,MAX,SUM,AVG
SELECT MIN(year) FROM movies;
SELECT MAX(year) From movies;	
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies; // return number of rown in movies
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE year>2000

* what is distinct command
= It can be applied on single column and multiple columns
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies_genre; // slect all the distinct genre from movies_genre table and genre column o/p will be comedy, horror etc
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM DIRECTORS ORDER BY first_name; // string firstname and last name combined should be unique

* GROUP BY CMD;
= It groups the rows as the per the coulmn we choose,It will create a set of the specific items we choose to group together .
SELECT year, COUNT(year) FROM movies GROUP BY year;
internall It will create a table for all the distinct year and in each of those it will contains the detials of the all the movies whihc are released in that year and then it will output the number of movies which are released in that year along with the year.   
2001{moviedeatails1,moviedetails} 
2002{moviedetials3,dmovies details4}
O/P 2001 50004
     2007  4568
SELECT year, COUNT(year) FROM movies GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;

What is DBMS?
Why we use DBMS?
. Write a query to get the second highest number from the student_marks table.
What is view?

 (SQL, Joins, Triggers, Stored Procedures, Normalization).
Employee table and explain how 1st normalization to BCNF has to applied on the table.

What is ACID property?
Update & Select query in DBMS
How to search any query in DBMS?

 What is the primary key?
  What is BCNF?
  What is ACID Property ??
Explain the meaning of each term in ‘ACID’ .
Give one real life example of ‘D-Durability’ ??
* how to do normalization?
= first find out all candiate keys, then write down all the prime attributes, check its in 2 nf, no part of a candite key is detrmining a non prime attribute, then remove any transitive dependancey, by giving them a seperate relation or table, and making them the superkey for that table
* What is Normalization ?
= Decomposition of set of attributes to minimize redundancy in such a way that relation function dependanccey between attributes remains lossless & reduce anomalies.

* What are the anomalies of Normalization?
= Insertion, update and deletion anomaly. when not in 1NF,2NF----4NF

*Types of Normalization?
= 1NF:- Their is no multivalued attribute, if their is then split it into seperate rows.
2NF :- When their exist no part of a candiate key determininga non prime attribute,partial dependencey(part of a candidate key or proper subset determines some other attribute other than itself) and relation is in 1NF, if their exist PD, then remove it by creating another relational table.
3NF:- For all non-trivial FD, When X->Y WHERE Y is a prime attribute then we have to remove that, & we are in 2NF.All prime attribute must depend on a s-key. no non prime attribute is transitively dependant ona key. No non prime attribute is depending a non prime attribut.
Ex:- X->Y, Y->Z, Z->A
NOTE:- Either X->Y   , either X is a superkey or Y is a prime attribute
**BCNF= Every FD X->Y , x is a superset of & Y its subset, (trivial) & X is superkey, Every BCNF is in 3 NF. or X->Y then either X has to be a super key or Y has to bea prime attribute
Note:- X->Y , X is auper key

** Achievabilty of BCNF
we cannot always gaurantee 
lossless, dependency preserving and BCNF
R(ABC)     FD{AB->C,C->B}
R1(AB)  =  {AB}
R2(CB)  = {CB}

5. What are the different types of DMBS?
6. What is RDBMS?
7. What is the difference between RDBMS and DBMS?
8. What is MySQL? Is it RDBMS or DBMS?
9. How we store data in RDBMS?
10. RDBMS also store data in .sql format file. So how can we differentiate the file of DBMS and RDBMS?
11. What is Primary Key? How it is different from Unique Key?
12. What is Foreign Key and How we use it to create connection between tables?
13. What are attributes?
14. What are the different types of SQL Languages? Explain them briefly with examples.

* What do you mean by cryptocurrency?
= A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.

* What is a Thread?
A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
Why Multithreading?
A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading are discussed below

* Process vs Thread?
The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.
Threads are not independent of one another like processes are, and as a result threads share with other threads their code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals). But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), register set, and stack space.
