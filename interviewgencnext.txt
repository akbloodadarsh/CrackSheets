Technical Round

*****************************General***********************
* What’s your favorite subject?
= DSA,OOPS,C++

* procedural programming language:-
= we have given a step by step instruction like c,ex:- we want to print every line from a file in c languages we have to write that how we will access the file and retirve the data from it, but in declatrive programming langye we say what we want, and we dont state how to get it,like sql we dirctly write what data we wnat to obtain from which table.Ex:- select moviename from movies where year>2000, no for loops is used etc..

* When I see a new emerging technology, how I research about it? Explain one technology I have recently researched about.
=

* Which is the most important stage in SDLC?
= each and every stage in sdlc is importnat, if we remove one step in cycle the their is a chance that the product will crash.

* Who invented Java
= James Gosling

* Is it possible to call one constructor from another in Java?
= Yes, any number of constructors can be present in a class and they can be called by another constructor using this() [Please do not confuse this() constructor call with this keyword]. this() or this(args) should be the first line in the constructor. This is known as constructor overloading.

* What was the name of java before named “java”
= The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.

* How to run a java program
= From Terminal install open jdk sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk. Write a java program and save the file as filename.java.Now to compile use this command from the terminal javac filename.java.To run your program that you've just compiled type the command below in terminal: java filename.

* why we need java as we have c, c++
= We need Java because it vastly increases the abstraction level, so developers do not need to worry about memory management and safety, garbage collection etc. So we can focus on the work and therefore increase our productivity. One is the use of bytecode and the desire to have a write once, run anywhere language.

* Software Development Life Cycle?
= Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

*What are the different stages in it?
= Feasibility study:- possible to make software or not
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document to Defining Requirements
3. Designing the Product Architecture Design Document Specification. This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.
4. Building or Developing the Product
5. Testing the Product
6.  Deployment in the Market and Maintenance

* how hashing works and its uses.
= An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table. The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

* What are the different Life Cycle Model?
= SDLC models followed in the industry −
Waterfall Model
Iterative Model
Spiral Model
V-Model
ITerative waterfall model
Agile
Dvops
Big Bang Model

* Which one of them is best and why?
= 

* What is the difference between concatenation of strings using ‘+’ and Stringbuffer. Advantages and Disadvantages of both and the instances where one would perform better than the other.
= String class is immutable thus when you concat too many strings because every time it creates new instance,it is slow.

* Briefly explain about Java
= orcale is responsible for maintancenc and improvement, it is 99% oops and 1 % is becuas of primitve datatyep. passed in refrence, contians packages mroe than 1200

* what happens if we don’t use static in main method?
= jvm dosent create a insance of the class, and it simply use the class name abnd call main emthod, jvm dosnt do that so it dosnt create a onstance of the class, and initialize the variable using constusctor if available.

**************************OS**************************
*What is Operating System?
= It acts as a resource manager(process,memory management),provides security & maintainence(their are daemons runnning in the background) provides convinence and gives us utilities,can be used even by someone from a non technical background and suppose a programmer writes some code in some programming language then like:- printf and we run that then we dont need to worry about how operating system displays the otput on the screen, and if a non technical is using chrome to browse internet , then os provides its resources and help it to connect to wifi using NIC, and the user need not to worry about how is it connecting, and if we want to search some file or app then we type its name and os finds it for us 

* what are interrupts?
= Interrupt is a signal emitted by hardware or software when a process or an event needs immediate attention. It alerts the processor to a high priority process requiring interruption of the current working process. In I/O devices one of the bus control lines is dedicated for this purpose and is called the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).When a device raises an interrupt at lets say process i, the processor first completes the execution of instruction i. Then it loads the Program Counter (PC) with the address of the first instruction of the ISR. Before loading the Program Counter with the address, the address of the interrupted instruction is moved to a temporary location. Therefore, after handling the interrupt the processor can continue with process i+1.While the processor is handling the interrupts, it must inform the device that its request has been recognized so that it stops sending the interrupt request signal. Also, saving the registers so that the interrupted process can be restored in the future, increases the delay between the time an interrupt is received and the start of the execution of the ISR. This is called Interrupt Lattency.

* UNI VS Multi Programming
= One program execute at a time in UNi programming, which lead s to huge wastgae of resources.
Multiple programming the operating system simply switches to, and executes, another job when current job needs to wait. ,& the concept of context switching is used,& its a ssingle cpu concept,multiple programs are stored in the ram and when a program is waiting because of the interupt, we can execute some other program at that time, to use the resources efficiently.The idea is to reduce the CPU idle time for as long as possible..Ex:- If supposse proram 1 generates calls a interrupt,Interrupt service routine and waiting for input from the keyboard, insetead of sitting ideal, the processor starts executing some other program and when the user will input something from the key board it starts executing pragram 1 again. 

* multiprogramming vs multitasking
= multiprogramming was a unix terminology & multitasking was something that is a extension of multiprogramming, as in multitasking the context switching & timesharing is used,this happens so fast that the users can interact with each program while it is running & the user feels like all the tasking are happening concurrently.

* Preemptive VS Non premptive
= Premptive means forcefully take control of something, & in context of OS, it means force a process to give the control of resources in CPU.The executing process in preemptive is interrupted in the middle of execution when higher priority one comes so OS allocates the resources to the higher priority one

nON Premptive:- Process has to give away control itself, Ex:- after completion of the process, or between interrupt,

* PSW program status word
= It determines the statu of the registers & mode of execution, ex:- whether its in user mode(0) or kernel mode(1). 

* user-mode vs kernel-mode
= user-mode:- It is preemptive means when a higer priority prcess comes then the control can be pased to it, forcefully.& in program status word it is denoted by 0.

kernel-mode:- It is non-premptive means thats when it is executing, the program either has to give control by itself and this happens only when the program completes exectution or when a interrupt happens.& in program status word it is denoted by 1. & the program can jump for user mode to kernel mode.

* fork():-
= this is a system call and is present in unistd.h header file & is used to creatre a new process or create a child process of the current program and it is a function call & retrun the id of a child process
Ex:- This can only run in unix based os && their is a command in windows os called spawn which does the same thing but i havent tried in windows 

Process 1
#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{
	printf("hello");  /// this is user mode
	fork();   /// this generates another process   & this is a system call which is in kernel mode thus process 2 is executed first
	printf("world");    // <---- after execution of the prcess 2 the program continues from here
	reutrn 0;
}
 
Process 2
#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{
	printf("hello");
	fork();
	printf("world");    /// process 2 starts from here even thought he whole program is copied
	reutrn 0;
}

O/P    hello world world

Ex 2 :-
	
	Process 1
#include<unistd.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int process_id,value = 0;
	process_id = fork();   /// this generates another process   & this is a system call which is in kernel mode thus process 2 is executed first && this return the prcessid of child process
	printf("process_id:- %d\n",process_id);    // <---- after execution of the prcess 2 in previous fork the program 1 continues from here
	if(process_id>0)printf("value = %d",value+5);  // this means the current process is parent , & this line is executed in process 1
	else if(process_id==0)printf("value = %d",value-5); 
	reutrn 0;
}
 
Process 2
#include<unistd.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int process_id,value = 0;
	process_id = fork(); // this fork is not called this means the porgram started after this line thus by default this will have value 0 which means this is in final child process 
	printf("process_id:- %d\n",process_id);    // <---- the execution of the prcess 2 starts from here
	if(process_id>0)printf("value = %d",value+5);
	else if(process_id==0)printf("value = %d",value-5);   // this will be executed in child process
	reutrn 0;
}

O/P    
process_id:- 25220   // this can be any other value too
value = 5
process_id:- 0
value = -5

**************************DBMS*****************************
**********USE ACTUAL QUERIES FOR TUTORIALS--------


* What is database?
= so what makes database differnet from traditional way of storeing and retrieveing or performing operations on data in file system is that database use various concepts like indexing,queriey optimizer etc, which makes it way faster , to make operations like updation,deletion, modfifyication,insertipon,deletion way faster,than a tradition file system. A database is a collection of related data which represents some aspect of the real world. A database system is designed to be built and populated with data for a certain task.

*What is DBMS? What are the different types of DMBS?
= Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.
DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement. The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other application programs. It provides an interface between the data and the software application. 
Types:-
1) Centralized Database
2) Distributed Database
3. NoSQL Database
4. Cloud databse
5. Object-oriented Databases
6. Hierarchical Databases
7. Network Databases
8. Personal database
9. Operational Database
10. Enterprise Database

* DBMS
DBMS applications store data as file.
In DBMS, data is generally stored in either a hierarchical form or a navigational form.
Normalization is not present in DBMS.
DBMS does not apply any security with regards to data manipulation.
DBMS uses file system to store data, so there will be no relation between the tables
DBMS has to provide some uniform methods to access the stored information.
DBMS does not support distributed database.
DBMS is meant to be for small organization and deal with small data. it supports single user.
Examples of DBMS are file systems, xml etc.

* RDBMS
RDBMS applications store data in a tabular form.
In RDBMS, the tables have an identifier called primary key and the data values are stored in the form of tables.
Normalization is present in RDBMS.
RDBMS defines the integrity constraint for the purpose of ACID (Atomocity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) property.
in RDBMS, data values are stored in the form of tables, so a relationship between these data values will be stored in the form of a table as well.
RDBMS system supports a tabular structure of the data and a relationship between them to access the stored information.
RDBMS supports distributed database.
RDBMS is designed to handle large amount of data. it supports multiple users.
Example of RDBMS are mysql, postgre, sql server, oracle etc.

*Why we use RDBMS?
= Multi-user access	It does not support multi-user access
Design to fulfill the need for small and large businesses
Remove redundancy and Integrity
Expensive. But in the long term Total Cost of Ownership is cheap
Easy to implement complicated transactions. 


* What is SQL?
= Structured query language, it started as a research project at IBM ,by boyee and codd, it has became a standard way to query, update, delte, modigy or insert in a database. It is a domain specific language, means that it can be only in database, ex:- we cant build a OS,webiste etc using sql, declatirve programming language

* What is the candidate key?
= A subset or a set of superkey attributes from whihc we can determine all the attributes is known as candiate key or a minimal attribute super key is called a candidate key,ex:- Super keys:- {A, bc} from which we can determine all the attributes then A will be the candidate key because it has minimum attributes from whihc we can dtermine all the other attributes or the closure of A+ can determine all the other attributes. Always check if their exist a subset of superkey by whihc if we find the closure of the subset of superkey if we are getting all the attributes or not.

IMP :- and we have to keep in mind one thing that if their exist a attribute whihc is not reachable by any functional dependency then we have to consider that in every candiate key.

* what is schema?
= How the data is organized & what are the tables and its relation between them

* What is super key?
= A subset or a set of attributes from whihc we can determine every other attribute then it is called a superkey.Ex:- Attributes a,b,c,d,e  and assume AB is superkey then their exist some functional dependency among the attribtes by whihc which when using Ab as super key we can determine every attribute.  

* Trivial vs Non trivial functional dependency
= If XY->X :- Trivial  when RHs is a subset of LHS 
  If X->C :- Non Trivial  When RHS is not a subset of LHS
   
* Cascade:- 
= It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the child data is either deleted or updated when the parent data is deleted or updated.It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the child data is set to NULL when the parent data is deleted or updated. A foreign key with cascade delete means that if a record in the parent table is deleted, then the corresponding records in the child table will automatically be deleted.
Ex:- 
CREATE TABLE products( product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,product_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,category VARCHAR(25));

CREATE TABLE inventory(inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY, product_id INT NOT NULL,quantity INT, min_level INT, max_level INT, CONSTRAINT fk_inv_product_id FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (product_id) ON DELETE CASCADE);


SQL-> PARSER,compiler -> query optimizer
parser:- breaks the queirey in chunks and tries to understand instruction then complier compiles it insome language like c,c++, java or in whihc the db it is writeen internally,
query optimizer = it says what is the most optimal way  to execute this statment, what is the best sequence we should execute, or what data structure we should use, and different database like, orcale, mysql etc will have different database
executor:- whihc executes the code

** Data manipulation langauage?DML
= SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

* SELECT CMD
= used to generate a result set with the tcolumns names mentione along with thier metadata.
the order of the column could be anything as given by the user, example we can select movie name first then year or vice-versa, a simple select query wil preserve the order of the data
 SELECT movie,year FROM movies;
 SELECT * FROM movies;
 
* INSERT
// single row insert
= INSERT INTO movies(id,name,year) VALUES (4155,'SCHINDLER LIST',1998)
// multiple row insert
INSERT INTO movies(id,name,year) VALUES (4155,'SCHINDLER LIST',1998), 4155,'JOBS',1999)
// Insert from one table  to another
INSERT INTO movies SELECT * FROM old_movies WHERE name IN ('pratt','lisa')
// Insert from one table  to another when schema are not same
INSERT INTO movies(id,movie) SELECT oid,omovie, FROM old_movies WHERE name IN ('pratt','lisa')

* UPDATE
= UPDATE movies SET movie="Gone",year=0 WHERE year = 1990; 

* DELETE 
= DELETE FROM movies WHERE id = 1;
if you want to remove all rows then same cmd but without a where clause


** DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
** CREATE
CREATE TABLE tname (id INT PRIMARY FOREIGN, lang VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)
we can write data type along with constraint to the columns

Constrians can be:-
NOT NULL:- ensure that column iis ntot null
UNIQUE:- eNSURe that eveyr value is unique
PRIMARY KEY:- A combination of not null andunique
FOREIGN KEY:- uniquely identifies a row/record in another tbale
CHECK:- Ensure that all values ina column satisfies a specific condiiotn
INDEX :- used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
(Indexing technizues are use dsucha as hashing, B+tree)

* ALTER
:- ADD, MODIFY DROP
= ALTER TABLE tablename ADD columnname DATATYPE(limit);
= ALTER TABLE tablename MODIFY columnname DATATYPE(limit);
= ALTER TABLE tablename DROP columnname;

* DROP
removes table along wiht all the data permananetly
= DROP TABLE tablename;
= DROP DATABASE database name;
= DROP TABLE tablename IF EXISTS;

* TRUNCATE
= TRUNCATE TABLE tablename;

* DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE
= GRANT , REVOKE
// user1 has access to that database
GRANT ALL ON db1 TO 'USER1'@'localhost'

// user1 has access to all database to run ALL the queries
GRANT ALL ON * TO 'USER1'@'localhost'
// role1 and role2 gets assigned to user1,user2
GRANT 'role1','role2' TO 'user1'@'localhost1','user2'@'localhost2';
// role3 gets access to world database to run select quesries
GRANT SELECT ON world TO 'role3';

* REVOKE
= Takes away the privelages
REVOKE INSERT ON *.* FROM 'Jefery'@'localhost';
REVOKE 'role1','role2' FROM 'user1'@'localhost','user2'@'localhost';
REVOKE SELECT ON world.* FROM 'role3';
******

* Aggrgate functions:- computes a single value on a set of rows and returns a aggregate,Ex:- 
COUNT, MIN,MAX,SUM,AVG
SELECT MIN(year) FROM movies;
SELECT MAX(year) From movies;	
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies; // return number of rown in movies
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE year>2000

* what is distinct command
= It can be applied on single column and multiple columns
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies_genre; // slect all the distinct genre from movies_genre table and genre column o/p will be comedy, horror etc
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM DIRECTORS ORDER BY first_name; // string firstname and last name combined should be unique

* SHOW CMD
//To see all the tables we have
= SHOW TABLES;

* DESCRIBE CMD
= If you want to check teh detials of the tabel
 DESCRIBE table_name

  
* GROUP BY CMD;
= It groups the rows as the per the coulmn we choose,It will create a set of the specific items we choose to group together even NULL values.
SELECT year, COUNT(year) FROM movies GROUP BY year;
internall It will create a table for all the distinct year and in each of those it will contains the detials of the all the movies whihc are released in that year and then it will output the number of movies which are released in that year along with the year.   
2001{moviedeatails1,moviedetails} 
2002{moviedetials3,dmovies details4}
O/P 2001 50004
     2007 4568
SELECT year, COUNT(year) FROM movies GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;

* WHERE and conditinal statemns
= WHERE is applied on individual rows and we use conditions along with them
Conditions :-
Not equal to:-   != <>
Equal to:-   =    (NOTE:-  = does not work with NULL,  Ex:- SELECT movie FROM movies WHERE rank = NULL;)
thus we use IS NULL & IS NOT NULL
SELECT movie FROM movies WHERE rank IS NULL;
SELECT movie FROM movies WHERE rank IS NOT NULL; 

// sleect all comedy movies genre
SELECT movie FORM movies WHERE genre = "COMEDY"; 

* lOGICAL Operators
= LIKE CMD
// For string 
// Prefix could be anything but at the end it should M
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE '%M', O/P blaM, MGOeqwG
// Sufffix could be anything but at the start it should M
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE 'M%', O/P blaM, MGOsdwG
// prefix & suffix could be anything but middle should M
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE '%M%', O/P blaMadsa, adsMGeqwOG
// at the _ their could be any character but the prefix and suffix should be same
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE 'M_ok', O/P Mbok, Mcok
in % their can be 0 or more chracter but in _ their has to be 1 charter
Use escape character \ if you want to treat  % and _ symbol as a normal charcter & not as a special symbol
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie LIKE '\%M\_ok', O/P %M_ok

* EXISTS
= The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery. The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.
SELECT SupplierName FROM Suppliers WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.SupplierID AND Price < 20) ORDER BY SupplierName;

SELECT moviename FROM movies WHERE EXISTS(SELECT director FROM directors WHERE movies.directorname = director)

* AND CMD
= for using multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE first_name LIKE "MID" AND last_name = "3"; 

* OR CMD
= if any conditon is true
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE first_name LIKE "MID" OR last_name = "3"; 

* IN CMD
= Equivalent of multiple AND condition but it creates a set and check if the item mentionsed is in the set or not
= SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genre IN ('COMEDY',HORROR);

* NOT CMD
= SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genre NOT IN ('COMEDY',HORROR);

* BETWEEN CMD
= SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2000;
Equivalent to in between a range but we have to check the lowvalue and high value
 SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 1999;
 thenn it will give a empty set
 
* HAVING 
where is used on individual rows and having is applied on groups
if we dont have group by having is same as where
// having is applied after grouping , where is applied before grouping
// FIND OUT ALL THE yEARS in WHich 1000>movies are releases
SELECT years, COUNT(years) year_count FROM movies GROUP BY years HAVING year_count>1000;

SELECT year, COUNT(years) years_count FROM movies WHERE rank>9 GROUP BY years HAVING years_count>1000;  

* LIMIT CMD
= 
//suppose we want only first 20 rows
SELECT year, name FROM movies LIMIT 20

* OFFSET
= how many rows from the start you wantr to ignore
// suppose in a webpage in our page 3 we want 40-60 rows from our table, or we want to ignore the first 40 rows and then get 20 rows 
SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40

* ORDER BY CMD
= It is used to sort the data , and for descending order we use DESC after applying ORDER BY

// select the top 10 movies in their descending year
SELECT movie FROM movies ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 10

* EXISTS
= It return true if a subqueirey return 1 or more values or not a empty set else it return false

* ALL
= returns true if the all the values in the set whihc is returned after the sub query meets the conditions stated
Ex:- SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rankscore >= ALL (SELECT MAX(rankscore) FROM movies);

* ANY
= returns true if any of the values in the set whihc is returned after the sub query, meets the conditions stated
Ex:- SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rankscore >= ANY (SELECT MAX(rankscore) FROM movies);
get all the movies whose rankscore >= maximum rankscore 

C-related subqueries:- & query withing a query where we have doing that operation again and again, and query optimizer may or may not optimi=ze the operation,more redable than some complex JOIns,
Ex:- SELECT emp_no,name FROM employees emp WHERE salary> (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = emp.department);

***JOINS
t1 columns, c1,c2....
t2 c2cc6..
left c1,c5,c3 && right c4,c2,c6   combined c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6
* INNER JOIN
= If we have table1 as T1 & Table 2 as T2 THEN INTERVSECTION the intersection of their columns along with the common rows wil be outputd

SELECT * FROM T1 JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; || SELECT * FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2;  // Intersection of c1 from t1 & c2 from t2 

* LEFT OUTER JOIN
= get all the values in left column and join it with right column and where it has same values fill the values of right and where it is not then place NULL their
Ex:- SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; || SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; // all values of left column with intersection of right column values

* RIGHT OUTER JOIN
= get all the values in left column and join it with right column and where it has same values fill the values of left and where it is not then place NULL their
Ex:- SELECT * FROM T1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; || SELECT * FROM T1 RIGHT JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2; // all values of left column with intersection of right column values

* FULL OUTER JOIN
= Its union of everything and if we are not able to find some same value in the column then place NULL their, its same as union of left outer join and right outer join
SELECT * FROM T1 FULL OUTER JOIN T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C2;
  
* Natural JOin
= A join where we have same column name across two tables,after joining the tables only a single column will exist with the same name
Ex:- T1 :- c1,c2
T2:- c1,c3,c4
SELECT * FROM T1 JOIN T2; || SELECT * FROM T1 JOIN T2 USING (c1);
crtes a table wiht columns c1,c2,c3,c4, no need to use ON clause

* K-joins
SELECT a.first-name, a.last_name FROM actors a JOIN roles r ON a.id=r.actor_id JOIN movies m ON m.id=r.movie_id AND m.name='Officer 444';
 joins are computationally most expensive
 
* what is a alias?
Suppose i want to sort by the count of year, and i use order by and i used the aggreater COUNT(year) then it wont work because it is aggregator opertor keyword, thus we have to use some other name for that to work, and we simply use a alias(year_name). 
= SELECT year, COUNT(year) year_name FROM movies GROUP BY year ORDER BY year_name;

*Write a query to get the second highest number from the student_marks table.
= SELECT marks FROM student_marks ORDER BY marks DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics

* What is view?
= In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. Types:-
=Dynamic views can contain data from one or two tables and automatically include all of the columns from the specified table or tables. Dynamic views are automatically updated when related objects or extended objects are created or changed. 
=Static views can contain data from multiple tables and the required columns from these tables must be specified in the SELECT and WHERE clauses of the static view. Static views must be manually updated when related objects or extended objects are created or changed.
Ex:- 
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS SELECT CustomerName, ContactName FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers]

* If Serial no. has to be Primary Key in a Database, should it be stored in a varchar or number datatype.
= Both are acceptable, but key has to be unique everytime. 

* Triggers
= Triggers are stored programs, which are automatically executed or fired when some events occur. Triggers are, in fact, written to be executed in response to any of the following events − DML,DDL,DCL
Triggers can be defined on the table, view, schema, or database with which the event is associated.
Use:-
Generating some derived column values automatically
Enforcing referential integrity
Event logging and storing information on table access
Auditing
Synchronous replication of tables
Imposing security authorizations
Preventing invalid transactions

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER display_salary_changes 
BEFORE DELETE OR INSERT OR UPDATE ON customers 
FOR EACH ROW 
WHEN (NEW.ID > 0) 
DECLARE 
   sal_diff number; 
BEGIN 
   sal_diff := :NEW.salary  - :OLD.salary; 
   dbms_output.put_line('Old salary: ' || :OLD.salary); 
   dbms_output.put_line('New salary: ' || :NEW.salary); 
   dbms_output.put_line('Salary difference: ' || sal_diff); 
END; 



* Employee table and explain how 1st normalization to BCNF has to applied on the table.
= First all the data should be in col & rows and the row and colums data does not have any repeating columns, then we remove any partial dependence by creating seperate tables for the attribut due to whihc it is occuring, and set at least one of attributes as the primary key in of that specific table,,and the remaining attributes are dependent on the primary key, and then we will remove the transitive dependencey , if we have any then finally we check that in every dependence our left side is superkey

* What is the difference between primary key and UNIQUE constraints? why are they called unique constraints?
= primary key should be able to access all the rows and UNIQUE constriant can be used for all the columns to check if the data we are storing in a column is alwyas unique and the column dosne thave to be a primary key colmn it can be used for any column, and jsut as primary key we have to specify in whihc column we want the data to be unique. and the column dosnet have to be apart of a primary key. 

* prime vs non-prime attribute
= prime attributes is part of a candidate key, & non prime is not part of a candidate key

* transaction
= A transaction is a single logical unit of work which accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database. Transactions access data using read and write operations.

* What is ACID property?
= Atomicity - A entire transaction takes place at once or dosent happen at all.  a transaction to transfer funds from one account to another involves making a withdrawal operation from the first account and a deposit operation on the second. If the deposit operation failed, you don’t want the withdrawal operation to happen either.

Consistency - A database must be consistent before and afer the  transaction. a database tracking a checking account may only allow unique check numbers to exist for each transaction

Isolation - multiple transaction happen independently without interferance. a teller looking up a balance must be isolated from a concurrent transaction involving a withdrawal from the same account. Only when the withdrawal transaction commits successfully and the teller looks at the balance again will the new balance be reported.

Durability - the changes of a successful transaction occur even if the system failure occurs.  A system crash or any other failure must not be allowed to lose the results of a transaction or the contents of the database. Durability is often achieved through separate transaction logs that can "re-create" all transactions from some picked point in time (like a backup).

* What is the super key?
= A super key can be a set of attributes which cna be used to identify ebeyr row uniquely. All super keys can’t be candidate keys but its reverse is true. SUPER KEY can be NULL;

* What is the candidate key?
= A minimum number of attributes required to identigy each row uniquely,or a minimal super key is candidate key,their can be multiple candidate keys. A candidate key can be NULL.

* What is the primary key?
= A primary keey is a candidate key which databse admin choose for a specific table. Primary key cant be NULL.

* what is a foreign key?
= A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together, a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table. The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables. The FOREIGN KEY constraint also prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to.


* how to do normalization?
= first find out all candiate keys, then write down all the prime attributes, check its in 2 nf, no part of a candite key is detrmining a non prime attribute, then remove any transitive dependancey, by giving them a seperate relation or table, and making them the superkey for that table

* What is Normalization ?
= Decomposition of set of attributes to minimize redundancy in such a way that relation function dependanccey between attributes remains lossless & reduce anomalies.

* why we do normalization?
= The primary purpose of the normalization is to reduce the data redundancy i.e. the data should only be stored once. This is to avoid any data anomalies that could arise when we attempt to store the same data in two different tables, but changes are applied only to one and not to the other.

* What are the anomalies of Normalization?
= Insertion, update and deletion anomaly. when not in 1NF,2NF----4NF

*Types of Normalization?
= 1NF:- an entity that does not have any repeating columns or data groups can be termed as the First Normal Form. In the First Normal Form, every column is unique.Their is no multivalued attribute, if their is then split it into seperate rows.

2NF :- When their exist no part of a candiate key determininga non prime attribute,partial dependencey(part of a candidate key or proper subset determines some other attribute other than itself) and relation is in 1NF, if their exist PD, then remove it by creating another relational table.
all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key

3NF:- For all non-trivial FD, When X->Y WHERE Y is a prime attribute then we have to remove that, & we are in 2NF.All prime attribute must depend on a s-key. no non prime attribute is transitively dependant ona key. No non prime attribute is depending a non prime attribut.
Ex:- X->Y, Y->Z, Z->A
NOTE:- Either X->Y   , either X is a superkey or Y is a prime attribute

**BCNF= Every FD X->Y , x is a superset of & Y its subset, (trivial) & X is superkey, Every BCNF is in 3 NF. or X->Y then either X has to be a super key or Y has to bea prime attribute
Note:- X->Y , X is auper key
-Fourth Normal Form (4 Normal Form):- A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued dependency.
By definition, a table is in Fourth Normal Form, if it does not have two or more, independent data describing the relevant entity.
-Fifth Normal Form (5 Normal Form) :- A table can be considered in Fifth Normal Form only if it satisfies the conditions for Fourth Normal Form and can be broken down into multiple tables without loss of any data. A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless.

** Achievabilty of BCNF
we cannot always gaurantee 
lossless, dependency preserving and BCNF
R(ABC)     FD{AB->C,C->B}
R1(AB)  =  {AB}
R2(CB)  = {CB}

Example of bcnf:-
EMP_ID   →    EMP_COUNTRY  
EMP_DEPT   →   {DEPT_TYPE, EMP_DEPT_NO}  
Candidate keys:

For the first table: EMP_ID
For the second table: EMP_DEPT
For the third table: {EMP_ID, EMP_DEPT}

Now, this is in BCNF because left side part of both the functional dependencies is a key.


* If you are given employee name, employee salary, employee id, then Create a table through SQL query.
= create functional dependency first then think of a table and do normalisation and then jump onto queries

* examplw of dbms
= xml file

* What is MySQL? Is it RDBMS or DBMS?
= MySQL Database Service is a fully managed database service to deploy cloud-native applications using the world's most popular open source database. and it is rdbms.

* How we store data in RDBMS?
= An RDBMS is a DBMS which manages a relational database. A relational database stores data in tables. Tables are organized into columns, and each column stores one type of data (integer, real number, character strings, date, …). 

* RDBMS also store data in .sql format file. So how can we differentiate the file of DBMS and RDBMS?
= The key difference is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications store data in a tabular form, while DBMS applications store data as files. Does that mean there are no tables in a DBMS? There can be, but there will be no “relation” between the tables, like in a RDBMS

* What is Primary Key? How it is different from Unique Key?
= primary key Unique identifier for rows of a table,
Unique identifier for rows of a table when primary key is not present
primary Cannot be NULL,unique Can be NULL
Only one primary key can be present in a table,	Multiple Unique Keys can be present in a table
Selection using primary key creates clustered index	Selection, using unique key creates non-clustered index

* What are attributes?
= an attribute refers to a database component, such as a table. It also may refer to a database field. Attributes describe the instances in the column of a database.

* What are the different types of SQL Languages? Explain them briefly with examples.
= Data manipulation langauage= SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE = CREATE,ALTER (ADD, MODIFY DROP),TRUNCATE
DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE = GRANT , REVOKE

* Where we can use CREATE command? Write a query using CREATE.
= To create, table, view, databse:- 
CREATE VIEW [brazil customer] AS SELECT amount FROM Customers WHERE country='Brazil'; 
CREATE TABLE customers(cusid INT, lang VARCHAR(50))
CREATE DATABASE db;
CREATE TABLE tname (id INT PRIMARY FOREIGN, lang VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)

* What are sql queries?
= A query is really a question or request for data. Structured Query Language SQL),is used to do various operations on data.

* What is the Difference between Delete and Truncate ?
= 
					Delete 														Truncate
Basic           It is used to delete specific data  		    It is used to delete the entire data of the table 
Where clause  	We can use with where clause 					It can’t be used with where clause 
Locking		    It locks the table row before deleting the row 	It locks the entire table 
Rollback 		We can rollback the changes.					We can’t rollback the changes 
Performance  	It is slower than truncate 						It is faster than delete 

* If you have to delete employee id – 400 from employee table, then.How will you delete it ?? Write its SQL query.
= DELETE FROM employee WHERE empid=400;

* What do you mean by cryptocurrency?
= A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.

* What is a Thread?
A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
Why Multithreading?
A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading are discussed below

* Process vs Thread?
The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.
Threads are not independent of one another like processes are, and as a result threads share with other threads their code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals). But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), register set, and stack space.
